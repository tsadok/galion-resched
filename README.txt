Galion ReSched is a resource scheduling utility (hence the name),
originally written for scheduling computers and rooms at a small
public library.

A demo of resched in action can be seen at this address:
http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/staff/resched-public/resched/

Released versions of the software may be downloaded from the library, here:
http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/staff/resched-public/

It may also be downloaded from the CPAN, here:
http://search.cpan.org/~jonadab/

If you want to follow development between releases, there is now also
a git repository here:
http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/git-repos/galion-resched.git

Be aware that code from git may not have been tested at all
and is generally not suitable for production use.
