resched is a resource scheduling utility (hence the name), originally
written for scheduling computers and rooms at a small public library.

A demo of resched in action can be seen at this address:

The software may be downloaded from the library, here:

or it may also be downloaded from the CPAN, here:

or from the equivalent location on any CPAN mirror.
