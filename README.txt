resched is a resource scheduling utility (hence the name), originally
written for scheduling computers and rooms at a small public library.

A demo of resched in action can be seen at this address:
http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/staff/resched-public/resched/

Released versions of the software may be downloaded from the library,
here:
http://cgi.galion.lib.oh.us/staff/resched-public/
or it may also be downloaded from the CPAN, here:
http://search.cpan.org/~jonadab/
or from the equivalent location on any CPAN mirror.

If you want to follow development between releases, there is now
also a git repository here:
https://gitorious.org/galion-resched
Be aware that code from git may not have been tested at all
and is generally not suitable for production use.

For system requirements, see INSTALL.txt
