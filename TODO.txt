Desired Changes:
 * The admin interface should have the ability to edit
   IP authentication settings.
 * The admin interface needs the ability to edit the
   resched_staffsch_flag table, especially because the
   meaning of the flags field in that table is not well
   documented and not easy to find by code diving.
 * When editing staff schedule hours (either regular or occasion),
   there should be a UI for getting ones from a different timeframe.
   The capability is there (sstart_datetime_foo), just needs UI.
 * The user should be able to set preferences for things
   like visual style and AJAX, which should then automatically
   kick in whenever they are logged in.  Ideally, it should
   also be possible to set preferences that only apply for
   the current user/IP-address combination.
 * Users should also be able to set their own nickname.
 * Users should be able to change their own passwords
   (subject to config variable approval).
 * The users table probably should be able to store initials,
   so that users at their own desks logged in with their
   own accounts can have their initials autofilled (subject
   to config variable approval).
 * Make alternate name order available by clicking a link.
 * Incorrectly specifying openingtimes or closingtimes should
   result in a MUCH friendlier error message.  Also, there
   should be a wizard or utility for putting the specs together.
 * Would like to sanity check date number inputs before storing
   them in the database.  If anybody finds a way to get an
   invalid date into the db, it could cause denial-of-service.
 * Provide a statistical_categories variable, just like
   categories but used only by the statistics (not sidebar stuff)
   and in preference to categories.
 * Test recent versions of IE.
 * After a suitable deprecation period, we should remove support in
   auth.pl for checking the deprecated (unhashed) password field.  The
   hashedpass field should be used instead.
 * The whole thing should be profiled for perf bottlenecks.
 * I have thought about adding a notes table, to allow notes
   to be attached to specific patrons (rather than just certain
   bookings) and appear any time they book anything.
 * Various things are hardcoded that should not be, e.g., the
   meeting room policy stuff.
 * General refactoring would not go amiss.
 * It would be really cool if it could use NCIP or something
   to consult the ILS patron database.  If we could just
   scan a barcode, and it would look it up and display the
   name, that would be nifty.  (In such a case a field should
   be added to the db for the barcode.)
 * Some of the error messages might ought to be improved.
   A lot of them only contain enough information to let me
   uniquely identify the line in the source that produced the
   error message.  Also, some of them are goofier than is
   strictly necessary.
 * At this time, db.pl only works with MySQL.  It would be
   nice to also have Postgres support.  In addition to
   db.pl, there is some date-conversion stuff that might
   need to change, in DateTimeExtensions.pm, and some
   custom SQL in the gatherstatsforadaterange function.
 * The tutorial has never been written, and probably
   should be, and a link added to the sidebar.
 * Implement the ability for users to change their passwords,
   and for the admin to set temporary passwords that must be
   changed before the user can do anything else.
