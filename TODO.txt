Desired Changes:
 * RFE: "Resend meeting room policy to this address."
 * When editing staff schedule hours (either regular or occasion),
   there should be a UI for getting ones from a different timeframe.
   The capability is there (sstart_datetime_foo), just needs UI.
   (Workaround: to get there with the current UI, you can select the
   time frame you want while /viewing/ a staff member's schedule, then
   click the edit link.)
 * Ideally, it should be possible for a user to set preferences that
   only apply for the current user/IP-address combination.
 * Make alternate name order available by clicking a link.
 * Incorrectly specifying openingtimes or closingtimes should
   result in a MUCH friendlier error message.
 * Would like to sanity check date number inputs before storing
   them in the database.  If anybody finds a way to get an
   invalid date into the db, it could cause denial-of-service.
 * Provide a statistical_categories variable, just like
   categories but used only by the statistics (not sidebar stuff)
   and in preference to categories.
 * Test recent versions of IE.
 * After a suitable deprecation period, we should remove support in
   auth.pl for checking the deprecated (unhashed) password field.  The
   hashedpass field should be used instead.
 * The whole thing should be profiled for perf bottlenecks.
 * I have thought about adding a notes table, to allow notes
   to be attached to specific patrons (rather than just certain
   bookings) and appear any time they book anything.
 * Various things are hardcoded that should not be, e.g., the
   meeting room policy stuff.
 * General refactoring would not go amiss.
 * It would be really cool if it could use NCIP or something
   to consult the ILS patron database.  If we could just
   scan a barcode, and it would look it up and display the
   name, that would be nifty.  (In such a case a field should
   be added to the db for the barcode.)
 * Some of the error messages might ought to be improved.
   A lot of them only contain enough information to let me
   uniquely identify the line in the source that produced the
   error message.  Also, some of them are goofier than is
   strictly necessary.
 * At this time, db.pl only works with MySQL.  It would be
   nice to also have Postgres support.  In addition to
   db.pl, there is some date-conversion stuff that might
   need to change, in DateTimeExtensions.pm, and some
   custom SQL in the gatherstatsforadaterange function.
 * The tutorial has never been written, and probably
   should be, and a link added to the sidebar.
 * Implement the ability for the admin to set temporary passwords
   that must be changed before the user can do anything else.
